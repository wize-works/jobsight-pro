## 🚧 The Problem

The construction and field services industry is a $13T global market — and one of the last to modernize.

Small to mid-sized contractors still rely on paper forms, whiteboards, and spreadsheets to run complex operations involving schedules, inspections, crews, and permits. These outdated methods lead to:

- Missed tasks and rework due to poor communication
- Budget overruns from untracked time/materials
- Compliance issues and delays due to lost documentation
- Painful legacy software with outdated UX, limited mobility

Over **70% of contractors** say they’re dissatisfied with current tools. Yet **nearly 80% are open** to adopting better digital solutions.

## 🛠️ The Solution

**JobSight** is an AI-enhanced SaaS platform that streamlines every jobsite operation into one responsive app.

- **Project & Task Management**: Gantt/calendar views, subtasks, dependencies
- **Field App (Offline-Ready)**: Daily logs, punch lists, photos, inspections
- **AI Assistant**: Transcribe voice notes, auto-generate daily reports, query data ("When was last inspection on Site A?")
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Crew notifications for changes, delay auto-adjustment
- **Cost Tracking & Invoicing**: Time, materials, job cost rollups, billing

Targeted at SMB contractors and trade teams (5–200 employees) underserved by tools like Procore, SAP, or spreadsheets.

## 💸 Business Model

- **Subscription-based SaaS**  
  → $49/month base + $10 per project or $15/user  
  → Freemium: 1 project, 2 users free  
  → Enterprise tier: training, onboarding, integrations

- **MRR Target**:  
  → $10K within 6–12 months via 100–200 SMB customers  
  → Initial focus on niche verticals (fire safety, HVAC, residential builders)

---

## 🌍 Market Opportunity

- $13T construction industry
- ~3.5M small to mid-size contracting firms globally
- <10% penetration of modern SaaS tools among SMBs
- High stickiness (firms don’t switch mid-project)
- High ROI per user (saving hours/week or $1K+ per mistake avoided)
