2. Increase likelihood of Free → Paid conversion
3. Reduce churn (via data lock-in + automation)
4. Shorten workflows (e.g. 3 clicks instead of 10)
5. Provide leverage (AI, integrations, extensibility)

## 📩 Feedback Loop

We continuously collect feature requests via:
- Beta onboarding calls
- In-app feedback buttons
- Typeform surveys
